    <strong><h1>My first encounter</h1></strong>
    <p>
      My first encounter with <b>html</html></b> was actually great because I was always
      interested in web designing
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope with the knowledge provided I will be able to do greater things
      with html.
    </p>
    <p>
      And most importantly become more creative and express my skills on the
      internet.
